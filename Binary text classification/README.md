Implementing the simple but effective machine learning technique, naive Bayes classification, and applying it to a binary text classification task (i.e.,spam detection)
1. nblearn.py will learn a na√Øve Bayes model from labeled data,
2. nbclassify.py will use the model to classify new data.
3. nbevaluate.py will print precision, recall and F1 scores based on the output of nbclassify.py on development (i.e., labeled) data.
